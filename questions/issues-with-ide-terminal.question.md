Textual apps are designed to be run in a terminal emulator.

The integrated terminals provided by some IDEs tend to be quite cut-down, so
many TUIs including Textual apps may not work as expected.

For recommended terminal emulators, see the 'Your platform' box in the
[Getting started](https://textual.textualize.io/getting_started/) guide.
