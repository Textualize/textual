Textual supports text selection for most widgets, via click and drag. Press ctrl+c to copy.

For widgets that don't yet support text selection, you can try and use your terminal's builtin support.
Most terminal emulators offer a modifier key which you can hold while you click and drag to restore the behavior you
may expect from the command line. The exact modifier key depends on the terminal and platform you are running on.

- **iTerm** Hold the OPTION key.
- **Gnome Terminal** Hold the SHIFT key.
- **Windows Terminal** Hold the SHIFT key.

Refer to the documentation for your terminal emulator, if it is not listed above.
