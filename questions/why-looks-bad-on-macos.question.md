The default macOS `Terminal.app` is getting rather old now; it has problems
such as being limited to just 256 colors, being slow to draw and not all
box-drawing characters are fully-supported. We recommend installing a newer
terminal such as [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/),
[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) or
[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/).
