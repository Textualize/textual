# Contributing Guidelines

🎉 **First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!** 🎉

## 🤔 How can I contribute?

### 🛠 Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion 📝 and find related suggestions. 🔎

Since GitHub Issue forms we only suggest you include most information possible.

You can see **issues** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
If it has, comment on the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like the same thing you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### 📣 Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality.
- Fix problems that are important to users.
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible outcome!
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions.


## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages 📝

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or less_.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at _72 characters_.
- Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, and _how_.
- Reference [issues](issues) and [pull requests](pulls) liberally after the first line.


## How to Contribute 🚀

- Please create or fix an [issue](issues) before creating a pull request.
- Fork the repository and create a branch for any issue that you are working on.
- Create a pull request which will be reviewed and suggestions would be provided.
- Add Screenshots to help us know what changes you have done.

## How to create an issue
You can contribute to this project by suggesting an enhancement, reporting a bug, and fixing documentation. Here's how to do it:
- Go to [issues](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/new/choose) page
- Select the issue you would like to open
- Use a descriptive title. It should take this format "[BUG]: Title"
- Add a description explaining the issue. You should give a detailed explanation. For example, the button on the website has a bright color which makes it hard to see the text in it.
