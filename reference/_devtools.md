# Devtools

## Installation

Using the Textual Devtools requires installation of the `dev` extra dependency.

https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#extras

## Running

TODO: Note how we run the devtools themselves and how we run our Textual apps
such that they can connect. Don't forget Windows instructions :)
We might also add a link to the documentation from the exception that gets
raised when the "dev" extra dependencies aren't installed.
