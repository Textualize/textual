# Devtools

## Installation

Using the Textual Devtools requires installation of the `dev` [optional dependency group](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/#dependencies-optional-dependencies).

## Running

TODO: Note how we run the devtools themselves and how we run our Textual apps
such that they can connect. Don't forget Windows instructions :)
We might also add a link to the documentation from the exception that gets
raised when the "dev" extra dependencies aren't installed.
