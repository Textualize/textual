## About

Textual adds interactivity to [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) with an API inspired by modern web development.

On modern terminal software (installed by default on most systems), Textual apps can use **16.7 million** colors with mouse support and smooth flicker-free animation. A powerful layout engine and re-usable components makes it possible to build apps that rival the desktop and web experience.

## Compatibility

Textual runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Textual requires Python 3.7 or above.

## Installing

Install Textual via pip:

```
pip install textual
```

If you plan on developing Textual apps, you should also install the development tools with the following command:

```
pip install textual-dev
```

See the [docs](https://textual.textualize.io/getting_started/) if you need help getting started.

## Demo

Run the following command to see a little of what Textual can do:

```
python -m textual
```
