| Name       | Type  | Default | Description               |

| `template` | `str` | `""`    | The template mask string. |

### The template string format

A `MaskedInput` template length defines the maximum length of the input value. Each character of the mask defines a regular expression used to restrict what the user can insert in the corresponding position, and whether the presence of the character in the user input is required for the `MaskedInput` value to be considered valid, according to the following table:

| Mask character | Regular expression | Required? |
| -------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| `A`            | `[A-Za-z]`         | Yes       |
| `a`            | `[A-Za-z]`         | No        |
| `N`            | `[A-Za-z0-9]`      | Yes       |
| `n`            | `[A-Za-z0-9]`      | No        |
| `X`            | `[^ ]`             | Yes       |
| `x`            | `[^ ]`             | No        |
| `9`            | `[0-9]`            | Yes       |
| `0`            | `[0-9]`            | No        |
| `D`            | `[1-9]`            | Yes       |
| `d`            | `[1-9]`            | No        |
| `#`            | `[0-9+\-]`         | No        |
| `H`            | `[A-Fa-f0-9]`      | Yes       |
| `h`            | `[A-Fa-f0-9]`      | No        |
| `B`            | `[0-1]`            | Yes       |
| `b`            | `[0-1]`            | No        |

There are some special characters that can be used to control automatic case conversion during user input: `>` converts all subsequent user input to uppercase; `<` to lowercase; `!` disables automatic case conversion. Any other character that appears in the template mask is assumed to be a separator, which is a character that is automatically inserted when user reaches its position. All mask characters can be escaped by placing `\` in front of them, allowing any character to be used as separator.
The mask can be terminated by `;c`, where `c` is any character you want to be used as placeholder character. The `placeholder` parameter inherited by `Input` can be used to override this allowing finer grain tuning of the placeholder string.
