# Input

A single-line text input widget.

- [x] Focusable
- [ ] Container

## Examples

### A Simple Example

The example below shows how you might create a simple form using two `Input` widgets.

=== "Output"

    ```{.textual path="docs/examples/widgets/input.py" press="D,a,r,r,e,n"}
    ```

=== "input.py"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/examples/widgets/input.py"
    ```


### Input Types

The `Input` widget supports a `type` parameter which will prevent the user from typing invalid characters.
You can set `type` to any of the following values:


| input.type  | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `"integer"` | Restricts input to integers.                |
| `"number"`  | Restricts input to a floating point number. |
| `"text"`    | Allow all text (no restrictions).           |

=== "Output"

    ```{.textual path="docs/examples/widgets/input_types.py" press="1234"}
    ```

=== "input_types.py"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/examples/widgets/input_types.py"
    ```

If you set `type` to something other than `"text"`, then the `Input` will apply the appropriate [validator](#validating-input).

### Restricting Input

You can limit input to particular characters by supplying the `restrict` parameter, which should be a regular expression.
The `Input` widget will prevent the addition of any characters that would cause the regex to no longer match.
For instance, if you wanted to limit characters to binary you could set `restrict=r"[01]*"`.

!!! note

    The `restrict` regular expression is applied to the full value and not just to the new character.

### Maximum Length

You can limit the length of the input by setting `max_length` to a value greater than zero.
This will prevent the user from typing any more characters when the maximum has been reached.

### Validating Input

You can supply one or more *[validators][textual.validation.Validator]* to the `Input` widget to validate the value.

All the supplied validators will run when the value changes, the `Input` is submitted, or focus moves _out_ of the `Input`.
The values `"changed"`, `"submitted"`, and `"blur"`, can be passed as an iterable to the `Input` parameter `validate_on` to request that validation occur only on the respective mesages.
(See [`InputValidationOn`][textual.widgets._input.InputValidationOn] and [`Input.validate_on`][textual.widgets.Input.validate_on].)
For example, the code below creates an `Input` widget that only gets validated when the value is submitted explicitly:

```python
input = Input(validate_on=["submitted"])
```

Validation is considered to have failed if *any* of the validators fail.

You can check whether the validation succeeded or failed inside an [Input.Changed][textual.widgets.Input.Changed] or
[Input.Submitted][textual.widgets.Input.Submitted] handler by looking at the `validation_result` attribute on these events.

In the example below, we show how to combine multiple validators and update the UI to tell the user
why validation failed.
Click the tabs to see the output for validation failures and successes.

=== "input_validation.py"

    ```python hl_lines="8-15 31-35 42-45 56-62"
    --8<-- "docs/examples/widgets/input_validation.py"
    ```

    1. `Number` is a built-in `Validator`. It checks that the value in the `Input` is a valid number, and optionally can check that it falls within a range.
    2. `Function` lets you quickly define custom validation constraints. In this case, we check the value in the `Input` is even.
    3. `Palindrome` is a custom `Validator` defined below.
    4. The `Input.Changed` event has a `validation_result` attribute which contains information about the validation that occurred when the value changed.
    5. Here's how we can implement a custom validator which checks if a string is a palindrome. Note how the description passed into `self.failure` corresponds to the message seen on UI.
    6. Textual offers default styling for the `-invalid` CSS class (a red border), which is automatically applied to `Input` when validation fails. We can also provide custom styling for the `-valid` class, as seen here. In this case, we add a green border around the `Input` to indicate successful validation.

=== "Validation Failure"

    ```{.textual path="docs/examples/widgets/input_validation.py" press="-,2,3"}
    ```

=== "Validation Success"

    ```{.textual path="docs/examples/widgets/input_validation.py" press="4,4"}
    ```

Textual offers several [built-in validators][textual.validation] for common requirements,
but you can easily roll your own by extending [Validator][textual.validation.Validator],
as seen for `Palindrome` in the example above.

#### Validate Empty

If you set `valid_empty=True` then empty values will bypass any validators, and empty values will be considered valid.

### Templates

When user input must follow specific rules and the value must be formatted accordingly, a `template` can help you.
Templates are string masks where each element specifies a well defined condition for the corresponding character typed by the user to be accepted.
For example, `AA-00` specifies a template that forces the input to contain 5 characters maximum, where the first 2 must be letters and the last 2 must be numbers. The `-` is a _separator_ (more on that below), and will be inserted automatically at the right position while the user types.
Defining a `template` inserts an additional implicit *[validator][textual.validation.Validator]*, and enables a custom editing mode based on the specified template.
A template can contain three character categories:

| Character       | Description                                                                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mask characters | Define the category of input characters that are considered valid in this position. |
| Meta characters | Various special meanings (see details below).                                       |
| Separators      | All other characters are regarded as immutable separators.                          |

The following tables shows the mask and meta characters that can be used in an input mask:

| Mask character | Meaning                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `A`            | Character of the Letter category required, such as `A-Z`, `a-z`.                                 |
| `a`            | Character of the Letter category permitted but not required.                                     |
| `N`            | Character of the Letter or Number category required, such as `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`.                |
| `n`            | Character of the Letter or Number category permitted but not required.                           |
| `X`            | Any non-blank character required.                                                                |
| `x`            | Any non-blank character permitted but not required.                                              |
| `9`            | Character of the Number category required, such as `0-9`.                                        |
| `0`            | Character of the Number category permitted but not required.                                     |
| `D`            | Character of the Number category and larger than zero required, such as `1-9`.                   |
| `d`            | Character of the Number category and larger than zero permitted but not required, such as `1-9`. |
| `#`            | Character of the Number category, or plus/minus sign permitted but not required.                 |
| `H`            | Hexadecimal character required. `A-F`, `a-f`, `0-9`.                                             |
| `h`            | Hexadecimal character permitted but not required.                                                |
| `B`            | Binary character required. `0-1`.                                                                |
| `b`            | Binary character permitted but not required.                                                     |

| Meta character | Meaning                                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `>`            | All following alphabetic characters are uppercased.                                  |
| `<`            | All following alphabetic characters are lowercased.                                  |
| `!`            | Switch off case conversion.                                                          |
| `;c`           | Terminates the input mask and sets the blank character to `c` (escaping not needed). |
| `\`            | Use `\` to escape the special characters listed above to use them as separators.     |

Any unescaped character that is not a mask or meta character is considered a separator.
In template editing mode, `Input` will always show a placeholder mask obtained by removing meta characters and replacing mask characters with the _blank_ character of `template` (if not specified, space is assumed), stylized using the placeholder style; if a `placeholder` parameter is specified, this overrides such a mask.
As user types input, only supported characters as specified in the mask are allowed; separators are added automatically at their expected positions, and moving/deleting by word acts on each group between two separators.
Required characters as specified in the mask will affect the validity of the input.

In the following example we show how to use a template to enter a valid credit card number.
Click the tabs to see the output at startup, after typing `1` `2` `3` and `4`, and after filling the whole input field.

=== "input_template.py"

    ```python hl_lines="6-13 25"
    --8<-- "docs/examples/widgets/input_template.py"
    ```

    1. A template acts as an implicit validator, so we can customize style accordingly.
    2. In this template, `9` is a required number and `-` is a separator (automatically inserted as you type); *blank* character is specified as `0`.

=== "Startup"

    ```{.textual path="docs/examples/widgets/input_template.py"}
    ```

=== "Partial input"

    ```{.textual path="docs/examples/widgets/input_template.py" press="1,2,3,4"}
    ```

=== "Complete input"

    ```{.textual path="docs/examples/widgets/input_template.py" press="1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8"}
    ```

Note that after typing `1` `2` `3` and `4`, `-` is automatically inserted for you since you reached an expected separator. Template can be used alongside `restrict` parameter and *[validators][textual.validation.Validator]* to further refine accepted input.
