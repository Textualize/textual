<!--
This is the template file for a syntax snippet of a Textual CSS type.
The comments below illustrate some common patterns.
-->

<!--
For a simple type like <integer>:

Describe the type in a short paragraph with an absolute link to the type page.
E.g., “The [`<my-type>`](/css_types/my_type) type is such and such with sprinkles on top.”
-->

<!--
For a type with many different values like <color>:

Introduce the type with a link to [`<my-type>`](/css_types/my_type).
Then, a bullet list with the variants accepted:

 - you can create this type with X Y Z;
 - you can also do A B C; and
 - also use D E F.

Consider ending with a link to the code/API that serves as ground truth for what values are accepted.
-->

<!--
For a type that accepts specific options like <border>:

Add a sentence and a table. Consider ordering values in alphabetical order if there is no other obvious ordering. See below:

The [`<my-type>`](/css_types/my_type) type can take any of the following values:

| Value         | Description                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `abc`         | Describe here.                                |
| `other val`   | Describe this one also.                       |
| `value three` | Please use full stops.                        |
| `zyx`         | Describe the value without assuming any rule. |
