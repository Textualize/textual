# Guide

Welcome to the Textual Guide! An in-depth reference on how to build apps with Textual.

## Example code

Most of the code in this guide is fully working&mdash;you could cut and paste it if you wanted to.

Although it is probably easier to check out the [Textual repository](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) and navigate to the `docs/examples/guide` directory and run the examples from there.
