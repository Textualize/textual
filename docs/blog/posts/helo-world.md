# New Blog

Welcome to the first post on the Textual blog.

<!-- more -->

I plan on using this as a place to make announcements regarding new releases of Textual, and any other relevant news.

The first piece of news is that we've reorganized this site a little. The Events, Styles, and Widgets references are now under "Reference", and what used to be under "Reference" is now "API" which contains API-level documentation. I hope that's a little clearer than it used to be!
