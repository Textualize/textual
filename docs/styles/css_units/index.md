# CSS units

Many CSS rules accept units of some sort, as opposed to a set of values.

The different CSS units are:

 - [color](./color.md) – e.g., to set the [background color](../background.md);
 - [integer](./integer.md) – e.g., to set the [`grid-size`](../grid/grid_size.md);
 - [percentage](./percentage.md) – e.g., to set the transparency of the [background color](../background.md); and
 - [scalar](./scalar.md) – e.g., to set the [width](../width.md) of a widget.
