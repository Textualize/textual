# CSS units

Many CSS rules accept units of some sort, as opposed to a set of values.

The different CSS units are:

 - [color](./color.md) – e.g., to set the background color of a widget;
 - [fractional](./fractional.md) – e.g., to set the opacity of a widget;
 - [integer](./integer.md) – e.g., to set the size of a grid layout;
 - [percentage](./percentage.md) – e.g., to set the transparency of colors;
 - [scalar](./scalar.md) – e.g., to set the dimensions of a widget; and
 - [text style](./text_style.md) – e.g., to style the text of a widget.
