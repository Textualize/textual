# Grid-rows

The `grid-rows` style allows to define the height of the rows of the grid.

!!! note

    This style only affects widgets with `layout: grid`.

## Syntax

--8<-- "docs/snippets/syntax_block_start.md"
grid-rows: <a href="../../css_types/scalar">&lt;scalar&gt;</a>+;
--8<-- "docs/snippets/syntax_block_end.md"

The `grid-rows` style takes one or more [`<scalar>`](../../../css_types/scalar) that specify the length of the rows of the grid.

If there are more rows in the grid than scalars specified in `grid-rows`, they are reused cyclically.
If the number of [`<scalar>`](../../../css_types/scalar) is in excess, the excess is ignored.

## Example

The example below shows a grid with 10 labels laid out in a grid with 5 rows and 2 columns.

We set `grid-rows: 1fr 6 25%`.
Because there are more rows than scalars in the style definition, the scalars will be reused:

 - rows 1 and 4 have height `1fr`;
 - rows 2 and 5 have height `6`; and
 - row 3 has height `25%`.
