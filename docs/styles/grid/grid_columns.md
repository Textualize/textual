# Grid-columns

The `grid-columns` style allows to define the width of the columns of the grid.

!!! note

    This style only affects widgets with `layout: grid`.

## Syntax

--8<-- "docs/snippets/syntax_block_start.md"
grid-columns: <a href="../../css_types/scalar">&lt;scalar&gt;</a>+;
--8<-- "docs/snippets/syntax_block_end.md"

The `grid-columns` style takes one or more [`<scalar>`](../../../css_types/scalar) that specify the length of the columns of the grid.

If there are more columns in the grid than scalars specified in `grid-columns`, they are reused cyclically.
If the number of [`<scalar>`](../../../css_types/scalar) is in excess, the excess is ignored.

## Example

The example below shows a grid with 10 labels laid out in a grid with 2 rows and 5 columns.

We set `grid-columns: 1fr 16 2fr`.
Because there are more rows than scalars in the style definition, the scalars will be reused:

 - columns 1 and 4 have width `1fr`;
 - columns 2 and 5 have width `16`; and
 - column 3 has width `2fr`.
