    """Wraps a widget so that it is mounted *lazily*.

    Lazy widgets are mounted after the first refresh. This can be used to display some parts of
    the UI very quickly, followed by the lazy widgets. Technically, this won't make anything
    faster, but it reduces the time the user sees a blank screen and will make apps feel
    more responsive.

    Making a widget lazy is beneficial for widgets which start out invisible, such as tab panes.

    Note that since lazy widgets aren't mounted immediately (by definition), they will not appear
    in queries for a brief interval until they are mounted. Your code should take this in to account.

    Example:

        ```python
        def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
            yield Footer()
            with ColorTabs("Theme Colors", "Named Colors"):
                yield Content(ThemeColorButtons(), ThemeColorsView(), id="theme")
                yield Lazy(NamedColorsView())
        ```
