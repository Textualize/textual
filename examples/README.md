# Textual Examples

This directory contains example Textual applications.

## Dependencies

Running these examples requires you to have Textual installed. Some of them also require [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/).
If you have them installed globally already, you can follow the run instructions below.

You can install the required dependencies globally, using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If you're comfortable with [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) for managing dependencies,
it's recommended to use these instead. There is a built-in Python 
library called ["venv"](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
which can be used to create virtual environments.


## Running the examples

To run them, navigate to the examples directory and enter `python` followed by the name of the Python file. If you're using a virtual environment to manage dependencies, make sure to activate it first.

```
cd textual/examples
python pride.py
```
